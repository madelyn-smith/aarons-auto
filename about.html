			<p>Aaron’s Auto Body was founded in 1976 by the late Aaron Smith, and has served the Avon community for nearly 50 years. Aaron's legacy continues with the business' current owners; his son, Darrin, and his grandson, Bradley.
				
			<p>We pride ourselves upon providing honest, quality collision work with a family atmosphere. You can rest assured that we put our best effort into every job, no matter the size. </p>

			<p>We’ve seen the damage New York winters can do to our customers’ vehicles and have decided to expand our services. We now offer undercoating to protect your vehicles from rust and corrosion.</p>
